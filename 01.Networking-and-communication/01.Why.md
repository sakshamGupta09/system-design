# Networking

- Networking is how different computers talk to each other.

## When you open Instagram:

- Your phone sends a request to Instagram’s servers.
- The server sends back posts, stories, comments.
- This back-and-forth happens over the internet.

Your phone and Instagram’s server are two different machines. Networking allows them to communicate.

## Communication
