# Networking

- Networking is how different computers talk to each other.

## When you open Instagram:

- Your phone sends a request to Instagram’s servers.
- The server sends back posts, stories, comments.
- This back-and-forth happens over the internet.

Your phone and Instagram’s server are two different machines. Networking allows them to communicate.

## Communication

- Communication is the exchange of data between systems using rules (protocols).


## Why is Networking Important in System Design?

- Modern systems are distributed.
- That means our frontend, backend, database, cache atc all components are on seperate machines.
- And all of them must talk to each other.


## Whatsapp

When you send a message:

- Your phone → WhatsApp server
- WhatsApp server → Recipient’s phone

If the network fails, 

- Message delayed
- Message not delivered
- Duplicate messages

That’s why networking reliability matters.


## Microservices Architecture

- In microservices, Each service runs on a different machine.
- They communicate using HTTP, gRPC and Message Queues.
