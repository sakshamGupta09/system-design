# IP Addresses

- Machines can talk to each other and exchange information. But how does they know which machine to communicate with?
- IP addresses can uniquely identify a machine on a network.


## Public IP

- Any device anywhere in the world can send a request directly to that IP address.


## Private IP address

- A network that works only inside a limited area and is not directly reachable from the global internet is called Private network.
