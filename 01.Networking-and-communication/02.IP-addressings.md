# IP Addresses

- Machines can talk to each other and exchange information. But how does they know which machine to communicate with?
- IP addresses can uniquely identify a machine on a network.


## Public IP

- Any device anywhere in the world can send a request directly to that IP address.
- When you open google.com, Your request goes to Google’s public IP. That server must be reachable from anywhere in the world.


## Private IP address

- A network that works only inside a limited area and is not directly reachable from the global internet is called Private network.
- Only devices inside that network can access each other. Outsiders cannot directly connect.
- At your home: Your laptop connects to WiFi, Your phone connects to WiFi, Your TV connects to WiFi, They all can communicate with each other but someone from another country cannot directly access your laptop?
- Improves security and IP conservation.

## NAT

- IPV4 has limited global public IPS around 4.3 billion.
- But we have so many more devices. If we keep assigning every device a unique IP, we would soon run out of them.
- NAT allows Many devices to share one public IP address.
