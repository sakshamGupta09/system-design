# Client Server Model

- The client-server model is a way of building software where One machine requests something (client) and Another machine provides it (server)


## Client

- The client is usually the software running on the user’s device, not the human and not the device hardware itself.

## Example 1: You Open Instagram

What happens?

- You (human) tap the app
- The Instagram app sends a request to Instagram servers

So:

- Client = Instagram app
- Server = Instagram backend

Your phone is just the machine running the client.
