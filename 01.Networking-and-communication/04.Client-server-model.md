# Client Server Model

- The client-server model is a way of building software where One machine requests something (client) and Another machine provides it (server).
- The communication happens over a network.


## Client

- The client is usually the software running on the user’s device, not the human and not the device hardware itself.

## Example 1: You Open Instagram

What happens?

- You (human) tap the app
- The Instagram app sends a request to Instagram servers

So:

- Client = Instagram app
- Server = Instagram backend

Your phone is just the machine running the client.


## Example 2: You Open a Website

- What sends the request?
- The browser (Chrome, Safari)

So:

- Client = Browser
- Server = Amazon’s backend


##  Example 3: Backend Calling Database

```go
Browser → Backend Server → Database
```
Here:

- Browser = Client (to backend)
- Backend = Server (to browser)
- Backend = Client (to database)
- Database = Server (to backend)

So the backend is both client and server depending on context.


## How clients and servers communicate

- Client sends the request.
- Request is transmitted over the network.
- Server receives the request, processes it and sends back the response.
- Client receives the response and processes it.

## Types of communication

- Request response model (HTTPS, Rest APIs)
- Persistent connections (Web sockets, FTP)
