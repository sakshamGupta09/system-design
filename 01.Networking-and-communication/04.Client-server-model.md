# Client Server Model

- The client-server model is a way of building software where One machine requests something (client) and Another machine provides it (server)


## Client

- The client is usually the software running on the user’s device, not the human and not the device hardware itself.
- You Open Instagram. You (human) tap the app. The Instagram app sends a request to Instagram servers. Client = Instagram app Server = Instagram backend. Your phone is just the machine running the client.
