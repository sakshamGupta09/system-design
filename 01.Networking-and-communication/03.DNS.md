# DNS

- Humans are good at remembering names than numbers. If I want to make a request to google server, I would prefer typing `google.com` instead of the IP of the server.
- But machines communicate with each other using IP addresses.
- So, we need a mapping between the domain names and IP addresses.


## How a DNS Request is Resolved (Step-by-Step)

- Let’s say you type: amazon.com


## Step 1: Browser Cache

- Your browser first checks Have I recently resolved amazon.com? If yes, it returns the cached IP else asks the OS.


## Step 2: OS Cache

- Your operating system keeps a small DNS cache.
- If found → return IP. If not → send request to DNS Resolver.
